###  What is Tor
Tor is a network of virtual tunnels that allows you to improve your privacy and security on the Internet. Tor works by sending your traffic through three random servers (also known as relays) in the Tor network. The last relay in the circuit (the "exit relay") then sends the traffic out onto the public Internet.

### What is Tor Browser
Tor Browser uses the Tor network to protect your privacy and anonymity

### Exi
Tor Browser typically selects exit nodes randomly for internet browsing. However, there are scenarios where using specific exit nodes is necessary—such as for testing, research, or accessing content from a particular country or region.
